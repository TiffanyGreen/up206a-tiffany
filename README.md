# Profile

Hi hi! I'm Tiffany and my background is in Theology and business. Coming out of undergrad, I had grand plans of opening a coffee shop that would also operate as a hub for community development. But as I worked in coffee shops and built my business plan I had concerns about the business' ability to provide for employees, coffee farmers, and the shop's surrounding neighborhood. So I stepped away from that coffee dream and centered community development as my focus. 

I'm from (*and currently live in*) St. Louis, where I developed an interest in neighborhood change, residential racial and economic segregation, and housing policy.

I took a coding course from this cool nonprofit in STL called [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/) in prep for data analysis in research. That was a *couple* of years ago, so dusting off those memories for this course. 

# Course Description

**UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science** According to @yohman:

> A graduate level course at UCLA's Urban Planning Department, 
> geared to inspire students with ideas that advances urban research through digital innovation.

# Objectives for the Course

Beyond the learning objectives listed in the syllabus, I intend to: 
* explore. While I learned a lot in the previous coding course, I didn't have bandwidth to explore and let it sink in. I have that time now. 
* take the time.
* think outside the box. 


# Project Ideas

I'm generally interested in housing and neighborhood change. 

When discussing with my partner for the project, we talked about: 

1. Environmental justice: 
   1. Exposure to air pollution
   1. Access (or lack of) to greenspace
   1. Access (or lack of) to healthy food
   1. Access (or lack of) to water
   1. Tribal environmental justice issues in OK
1. Housing: 
   1. Occupancy profile - owner occupied or rented
   1. Housing type / age
   1. How ^ correlate to environmental justice issues
   1. Housing vouchers influence on property value
1. Unhoused exposure to air pollution
   1. Especially with fire risk
1. Tenant rights movements in Berlin
   1. Vacancy rates and unhoused rates
