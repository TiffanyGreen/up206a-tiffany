["Disrupting Displacement Financing in Oakland and Beyond](https://antievictionmap.com/s/Disrupting-Displacement-Financing.pdf) talks about how long-time Oakland, CA residents are displaced from their homes. Landlords are buying properties and increasing the rent so high that tenants are forced to leave or are evicted. The paper shows how certain banks, specifically First Republic Bank, are financing these property purchases, perhaps with the knowledge of the landlords' model of increasing rents and causing displacement, which violates their committments to low- and middle- income communities and CRA requirements. 

Erin McElroy and Carla Leshne, AEMP researched, analyzed, and mapped the data in this paper. I appreciated reading this paper because I felt like I could see how they explored all of the data, followed the threads that were interesting, and it brought them to conclusions that were clearly contrary to the stated values of the banks, then offered potential steps forward. They first mapped the foreclosures and evictions in Oakland and followed those points to find the funding. They were able to aggregate that data to find the banks with the most influence on financing displacement, which led them to the top bank: First Republic Bank. They mapped the foreclosures and evictions only from First Republic Bank and placed that next to a map of redlining maps from the HOLC; they were very similar. This paper speaks to financial institutions' inherent conflict with serving community and seeking quick profits.
