### The Value of Residential Streets by Adam Millard-Ball

Millard-Ball's main point in this article is that especially in areas where land costs are high, reducing the width of streets would increase economic efficiency for city residents and save them money. Currently in the States, the width requirements are established by subdivision ordinances, which broadly do not consider the value of the land and can misallocate access, movement, and storage value. This causes street land to be underutlitzed and unpriced, while the land surrounding the streets increases in price so much that it can be unaffordable. Reducing street size gives more land to the property owner to make the land more productive, especially as wider streets does not icrease capacity on the street anyway.

My initial thoughts about changing these regulations are that it gives a lot of power to developers. Even developers who are not motivated to make huge financial windfalls are still beholden to their market. The market for new development are often from outside the community and are inherently people with buying power. How can we make these changes while considerig equity for those without direct influence on the product? Further, developers are only accountable to the community insomuch as members insert themselves into the development and entitlement process. The community surrounding new developments where changing street width or even simply the setbacks for transit developments often long for the days of the wide-open Los Angeles of the 70's and 80's. I'm curious how this research will be communicated and received by community members.
