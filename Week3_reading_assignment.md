I watched Geoff Boeing’s presentation to the Urban Planning GIS course last quarter, and I immediately emailed a mentor who teaches GIS at a university in my hometown. I was curious what he’s teaching and how he’s going about the course, as well as what tools and libraries he uses in his work and in his course. (I have a sneaking suspicion that it his class is Esri-based, but he explores and uses non-Esri software.) I’ll report back when I hear from him! I mention this because the conversation excited me about possibilities within data science for advancing urban science and research. The more you explore questions, the more questions you have. And you can see where the data is lacking. These skillsets allow you to fill the gaps. 

As an aside, the conversations around disaster aftermath and prevention are really interesting to me. I lived through a pretty horrific tornado in 2011 and saw firsthand how a blocked roadway (or a square mile of roadways) can prevent access. Emergency vehicles couldn’t get access. We didn’t have access. It was just pure pandemonium. I would be interested in mapping the tornado and the road closures using OSMnx.
