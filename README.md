# Profile

Hi hi! I'm Tiffany and my background is in Theology and business. Coming out of undergrad, I had grand plans of opening a coffee shop that would also operate as a hub for community development. But as I worked in coffee shops and built my business plan I had concerns about the business' ability to provide for employees, coffee farmers, and the shop's surrounding neighborhood. So I stepped away from that coffee dream and centered community development as my focus. 

I'm from (*and currently live in*) St. Louis, where I developed an interest in neighborhood change, residential racial and economic segregation, and housing policy.

I took a coding course from this cool nonprofit in STL called [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/) in prep for data analysis in research. That was a *couple* of years ago, so dusting off those memories for this course. 

# Course Description

**UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science** According to @yohman:

> A graduate level course at UCLA's Urban Planning Department, 
> geared to inspire students with ideas that advances urban research through digital innovation.

# Objectives for the Course

Beyond the learning objectives listed in the syllabus, I intend to: 
* explore. While I learned a lot in the previous coding course, I didn't have bandwidth to explore and let it sink in. I have that time now. 
* take the time.
* think outside the box. 


# Project Ideas

I'm generally interested in housing and neighborhood change. Working with my *(hopeful)* future partner later today to explore some more concrete ideas.
